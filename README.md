# Mars rover kata

This 5-line solution is optimised for fewest lines of code, but I still made it work for a continuos grid which allows continuous rotation. Thanks to Rowan Lee for the challenge at the 2025-10-16 LSCC event :D.
Obviously there is a lot of wasted compute here, but efficiency of compute wasn't the challenge.
This was created using red-green-refactor test driven development!
